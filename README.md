README

This is the README file for a Github repository for the Linked Archival Metadata: A Guidebook. I hope to update the text version of the Guidebook on a regular basis, and the 'Hub is a place for folks to transparently see how things are progressing. For more information, see -- http://sites.tufts.edu/liam/

Wish the project luck.
